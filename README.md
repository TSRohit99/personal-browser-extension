## Personal Broswer Extension 

I made this chrome extension to test my blogging platform(generate test blogs) and fetching a crypto-currency price (as I am learning blockchain) so that I can stay up to date with the price whenever I am surfing the web or coding.

## Tech Stack and basic overview
- Made my own API using official @google/generative-ai package (npm) to generate contents.
- Backend is on Node environment with express and deployed on render https://personal-browser-extension.onrender.com/generate?topic=travel
- Used Coingecko API for fetching the crypto data.
